        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>The need: The State as the sovereign owner of mineral lands and resources has the power and authority to enter into
            agreement with contractors who can extract and exploit these resources. Such activities are documented in the form
            of contracts, agreements, permits and leases. These are important documents that specify the duties and
            responsibilities of the government and the contractor, payments required and due as well as the expected benefits of
            the communities hosting the extractive operations.</p>

        <p>While full-text contracts are public documents, these are not readily available for the public. Requesting these
            from companies may not always be granted. Accessing archives of government agencies may require authorizations and
            certifications. The possibility of information mismatch and knowledge gap occurs.</p>

        <p>The response: PH-EITI aims to improve public access and transparency in the extractive sector through the
            publication of mining, oil and gas contracts entered into by the government, including contract annexes and other
            supporting documents. organized around a rigorous method to categorizing contract content and built to enable easier
            reading of large PDF files, the tool is an online portal offering a growing collection of oil, gas and mining
            contracts for review and download. Guidance notes are also available to enable more citizens to understand key
            aspects of these documents that impact the lives of many Filipinos and govern billions of pesos in revenue for the
            country.</p>
